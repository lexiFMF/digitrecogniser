No Tensorflow/Keras, just numpy and pandas

## Notes
Very simple, unoptimised and a little finnicky, was just a test to see if i understood the concepts of backprop/gradient descent. All you need is to run the program in the same directory as the csv files from the zip, and it will train itself and then start going through the test.csv file, showing an image and prediction. First machine learning project and the accuracy is around 85-90% (on the final steps of training, am yet to implement a test/train split), which is regardless impressive for such a simple little program
